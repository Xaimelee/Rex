 # Mongol Mission Events
 mch_missions.6.t:1 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the Dalai Lama"
 mch_missions.6.d:1 "[Root.Monarch.GetName], Khan of the Mongols, was skeptical about the value of meeting with a frail, bald monk. No doubt this Dalai Lama is simply grasping to the last vestiges of his broken power. With Tibet now under [Root.GetAdjective] rule there was no real need to negotiate with the old order. Yet many chieftains among the Mongols had embraced the Buddhist faith and looked to the Lama for spiritual guidance, and so the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was compelled to attend.\n\nMuch to the surprise of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the Dalai Lama has made a truly interesting offer. If we were to proclaim Tibetan Buddhism to be the new faith of all the Mongol people, the Dalai Lama would in turn reveal to the world that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is Genghis Khan reborn. The legitimacy this would afford to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would be immense, yet not all would readily accept this new faith."
 mch_missions.6.a:0 "Accept cooperation with the Dalai Lama."
 mch_missions.6.b:0 "We won't listen to this superstitious nonsense."
 mongol_tibetan_rulership_tt:1 "All owned provinces in the §YTibet§! region with §YVajrayana§! religion get the §YConquest of Tibet§! modifier for §Y20 years§!, giving the following effects:\nLocal Autonomy: §G-0.05§!\nLocal Unrest: §G-3§!"
 mch_missions.7.t:0 "Reuniting the Mongols"
 mch_missions.7.d:0 "Since the fall of the great Mongol Empire there have been many attempts to reunite the Mongol people. None have succeeded for more than a brief moment. Like many before us we have assembled a horde with warriors and chieftains from every tribe, but this unity will likely be temporary unless we strive for greater unity. We could, as Genghis Khan did, proclaim that all the Mongols are one people, with all division between them made obsolete. Alternatively we could reorganize the tribes, recognizing their distinctiveness but clearly defining their rights and territories."
 mch_missions.7.a:0 "We are all Mongols."
 mch_missions.7.b:0 "The tribes must be reorganized."
 unite_mongol_culture_tt:1 "All owned provinces with §YKorchin§!, §YKhalka§!, or §YOirat§! culture will change to §YMongol§! culture"
 # Mongolian Ideas
 KHA_ideas:0 "Mongolian Ideas"
 KHA_ideas_start:0 "Mongolian Traditions"
 KHA_ideas_bonus:0 "Mongolian Ambition"
 ikh_mongol_uls:0 "Ikh Mongol Uls"
 ikh_mongol_uls_desc:1 "As the original Mongols, we Mongols of the Ilkh Mongol Uls ('Great Mongolian State') see ourselves as the primary heirs to Genghis Khan's great empire. Given the slightest chance, our people would seek to emulate the exploits of the Great Khan and reclaim his legacy, reuniting the once-vast territories of the Mongol Khanate."
 northern_yuan:0 "The Northern Yuan"
 northern_yuan_desc:2 "In the 13th century, Kublai Khan conquered China and founded the Yuan dynasty. Claiming Genghis' title of Great Khan as well as that of the Emperor of China, the Yuan state was sometimes known as the Empire of the Great Khan. Although eventually defeated by the Ming, who confined our power to Mongolia itself, memory of the Yuan lives on, as does the ambition to reclaim the Celestial Throne if ever the chance should arise."
 ghostly_horses_of_the_plain:0 "Ghostly Horses of the Plain"
 ghostly_horses_of_the_plain_desc:0 "The prowess of the Mongolian horsemen is renowned across the entire world. Our enemies will tremble with fear at the sight of a dust cloud in the distance, fearing that it might signify our cavalry's approach!"
 yams_of_the_great_khan:0 "Yams of the Great Khan"
 yams_of_the_great_khan_desc:2 "In order to ensure that messengers could travel fast enough to keep up with Mongol armies, Genghis Khan instituted a system of relay stations or 'yams', which were set up every 30-60 km to provide food, shelter and spare horses for Mongol army messengers. This allowed messages to travel as fast as a horse can gallop, with fatigue no longer slowing the speed a messenger could travel. By these means, our empire was able to overcome the logistical problems caused by the vast scale of the Pax Mongolica - at least temporarily."
 mongolian_mobility:0 "Mongolian Mobility"
 mongolian_mobility_desc:2 "Each of our soldiers typically maintains 3 or 4 horses, allowing them to change horse each time their mount becomes tired and so travel at high speed for days without stopping. Furthermore, their extra mounts provide them with food reserves through mare's milk as well as horsemeat, making our armies far less vulnerable to starvation than other, so-called civilized nations' armies. This allows us to outmaneuver our enemies with ease, covering a staggering amount of territory in shorter periods than they had believed to be possible."
 MNG_kheshig:0 "The Kheshig"
 MNG_kheshig_desc:0 "The Kheshig once formed the formidable bodyguard of the Great Mongol Khan. Their descendants will continue to protect the Khans of Mongolia as they ride into battle against their people's foes!"
