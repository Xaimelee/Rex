 # Mongol Mission Events
 mch_missions.6.t:1 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the Dalai Lama"
 mch_missions.6.d:1 "[Root.Monarch.GetName], Khan of the Mongols, was skeptical about the value of meeting with a frail, bald monk. No doubt this Dalai Lama is simply grasping to the last vestiges of his broken power. With Tibet now under [Root.GetAdjective] rule there was no real need to negotiate with the old order. Yet many chieftains among the Mongols had embraced the Buddhist faith and looked to the Lama for spiritual guidance, and so the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was compelled to attend.\n\nMuch to the surprise of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the Dalai Lama has made a truly interesting offer. If we were to proclaim Tibetan Buddhism to be the new faith of all the Mongol people, the Dalai Lama would in turn reveal to the world that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is Genghis Khan reborn. The legitimacy this would afford to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would be immense, yet not all would readily accept this new faith."
 mch_missions.6.a:0 "Accept cooperation with the Dalai Lama."
 mch_missions.6.b:0 "We won't listen to this superstitious nonsense."
 mongol_tibetan_rulership_tt:1 "All owned provinces in the §YTibet§! region with §YVajrayana§! religion get the §YConquest of Tibet§! modifier for §Y20 years§!, giving the following effects:\nLocal Autonomy: §G-0.05§!\nLocal Unrest: §G-3§!"
 mch_missions.7.t:0 "Reuniting the Mongols"
 mch_missions.7.d:0 "Since the fall of the great Mongol Empire there have been many attempts to reunite the Mongol people. None have succeeded for more than a brief moment. Like many before us we have assembled a horde with warriors and chieftains from every tribe, but this unity will likely be temporary unless we strive for greater unity. We could, as Genghis Khan did, proclaim that all the Mongols are one people, with all division between them made obsolete. Alternatively we could reorganize the tribes, recognizing their distinctiveness but clearly defining their rights and territories."
 mch_missions.7.a:0 "We are all Mongols."
 mch_missions.7.b:0 "The tribes must be reorganized."
 unite_mongol_culture_tt:1 "All owned provinces with §YKorchin§!, §YKhalka§!, or §YOirat§! culture will change to §YMongol§! culture"
 # Mongolian Ideas
 KHA_ideas:0 "Mongolian Ideas"
 KHA_ideas_start:0 "Mongolian Traditions"
 KHA_ideas_bonus:0 "Mongolian Ambition"
 ikh_mongol_uls:0 "Ikh Mongol Uls"
 ikh_mongol_uls_desc:1 "As the original Mongols, we Mongols of the Ilkh Mongol Uls ('Great Mongolian State') see ourselves as the primary heirs to Genghis Khan's great empire. Given the slightest chance, our people would seek to emulate the exploits of the Great Khan and reclaim his legacy, reuniting the once-vast territories of the Mongol Khanate."
 northern_yuan:0 "The Northern Yuan"
 northern_yuan_desc:2 "In the 13th century, Kublai Khan conquered China and founded the Yuan dynasty. Claiming Genghis' title of Great Khan as well as that of the Emperor of China, the Yuan state was sometimes known as the Empire of the Great Khan. Although eventually defeated by the Ming, who confined our power to Mongolia itself, memory of the Yuan lives on, as does the ambition to reclaim the Celestial Throne if ever the chance should arise."
 ghostly_horses_of_the_plain:0 "Ghostly Horses of the Plain"
 ghostly_horses_of_the_plain_desc:0 "The prowess of the Mongolian horsemen is renowned across the entire world. Our enemies will tremble with fear at the sight of a dust cloud in the distance, fearing that it might signify our cavalry's approach!"
 yams_of_the_great_khan:0 "Yams of the Great Khan"
 yams_of_the_great_khan_desc:2 "In order to ensure that messengers could travel fast enough to keep up with Mongol armies, Genghis Khan instituted a system of relay stations or 'yams', which were set up every 30-60 km to provide food, shelter and spare horses for Mongol army messengers. This allowed messages to travel as fast as a horse can gallop, with fatigue no longer slowing the speed a messenger could travel. By these means, our empire was able to overcome the logistical problems caused by the vast scale of the Pax Mongolica - at least temporarily."
 mongolian_mobility:0 "Mongolian Mobility"
 mongolian_mobility_desc:2 "Each of our soldiers typically maintains 3 or 4 horses, allowing them to change horse each time their mount becomes tired and so travel at high speed for days without stopping. Furthermore, their extra mounts provide them with food reserves through mare's milk as well as horsemeat, making our armies far less vulnerable to starvation than other, so-called civilized nations' armies. This allows us to outmaneuver our enemies with ease, covering a staggering amount of territory in shorter periods than they had believed to be possible."
 MNG_kheshig:0 "The Kheshig"
 MNG_kheshig_desc:0 "The Kheshig once formed the formidable bodyguard of the Great Mongol Khan. Their descendants will continue to protect the Khans of Mongolia as they ride into battle against their people's foes!"

  # Japanese Missions
 JAP_expand_the_kokka_title:0 "Expand the Kokka"
 JAP_expand_the_kokka_desc:0 "Our clan's domain supports all our political efforts. Though it may have sufficed for previous generations, it is not lucrative enough to fund all our ambitions. We must expand our powerbase!"
 JAP_balance_the_four_divisions_title:0 "Balance the Four Divisions"
 JAP_balance_the_four_divisions_desc:0 "Society is divided into four parts, which need to be in perfect balance to create a truly harmonious society. This period of ours is sadly one of gekokujo, where even the lowest can overcome the highest in society. We must find a way to remedy this grievous ill and restore harmony."
 JAP_balance_the_four_divisions_tt:0 "§YTwo estates§! must have §Y70§! or greater loyalty"
 JAP_establish_political_supremacy_title:0 "Win Political Supremacy"
 JAP_establish_political_supremacy_desc:0 "Our aspirations are greater than any mere daimyo's. It is our duty, our destiny, to reach the highest levels of power in the land."
 JAP_issue_new_erizeni_rei_title:0 "Issue New Erizeni-Rei"
 JAP_issue_new_erizeni_rei_desc:0 "Sound finances are the bedrock of stable government. To ensure that order is maintained and trade continues, we must encourage a steady flow of good coins into the realm."
 JAP_survey_the_secret_fields_title:0 "Survey the Secret Fields"
 JAP_survey_the_secret_fields_desc:0 "It is embarrassingly common in the provinces for farmers to maintain so-called 'secret fields', farmland hidden from the eyes of tax collectors. A thorough accounting of these unreported properties should significantly help bolster the health of our economy and our coffers."
 JAP_construct_the_gokaido_title:0 "Construct the Gokaido"
 JAP_construct_the_gokaido_desc:0 "Although our domestic opponents have been subdued, it is important that we keep these lords in check. Building a new system of roads and waystations would help make the daimyos' domains easier to reach from the capital and boost local commerce along those routes in the process."
 JAP_permit_ryogaesho_title:0 "Permit Ryogaesho"
 JAP_permit_ryogaesho_desc:0 "Many daimyos have suffered from erratic finances, causing some to default on loans they have taken. Enabling smaller money change shops to offer more reliable loans, and to back up those loans with our own reserves, should help stabilize daimyos' finances and perhaps foster a healthier domestic economy."
 JAP_pacify_the_north_title:0 "Pacify the North"
 JAP_pacify_the_north_desc:0 "The people of Ezochi are a thorn in our side, operating as a base for brigands who come south to hound our peaceful subjects. We must extend our benevolent rule north to this wild land, and ensure that the people there learn the benefits of our ways."
 JAP_take_the_thousand_islands_title:0 "Take the Kurils"
 JAP_take_the_thousand_islands_desc:0 "The Son of Heaven requests that the islands to the north of Japan be settled with landless Ronin for the peace of the Emperor."
 JAP_siberian_intervention_title:0 "Siberian Intervention"
 JAP_siberian_intervention_desc:0 "Our involvement in Manchuria and among the Thousand Islands requires a new defensive frontier. The taigas of Siberia may not be the most alluring of lands, but they will provide a good first line of defense against anyone from the west who wishes to attack our more prosperous territories."
 JAP_sankin_kotai_title:0 "Sankin-Kotai"
 JAP_sankin_kotai_desc:0 "Rather than simply imprison the worst lords and risk rebellion, we can take a far more subtle approach to weakening and integrating them by obligating them to visit the capital regularly. Implementing a policy of 'alternate attendance' would compel the lords to maintain two residencies, one in their own domains and one in the capital, and of course they would be expected to travel back and forth in extravagant processions. The cost of all this would bankrupt all but the wealthiest lords, preventing them from accumulating the funds they would need to maintain a private army. It would also help bolster our own power in the capital, and make it a far more attractive place for courtiers and diplomats."
 JAP_encourage_financial_cliques_title:0 "Encourage Wealth Cliques"
 JAP_encourage_financial_cliques_desc:0 "As our economy continues to grow, the merchant classes have inevitably grown in wealth and power. Although officially they are at the bottom of the social ladder, it's hard to look down on people so rich and so financially adept. Perhaps it is time we actively supported these merchants, and helped them develop these... what should we call these mercantile conglomerates? 'Zaibatsu'?"
 JAP_emperor_of_china_title:0 "Imperial Mandate"
 JAP_emperor_of_china_desc:0 "We were once called 'dwarfs' by China, but now China is dwarfed by us! The Son of Heaven has no equal; we must assert the Chrysanthemum Throne's supremacy over all other rulers."
 JAP_secure_the_pacific_title:0 "Secure the Pacific"
 JAP_secure_the_pacific_desc:0 "As our reach grows, so too does our need for defense. While we look to the west for opportunities to grow, we must also take heed of the great expanse to our east, the Pacific Ocean. Who knows what threats may come from that direction? It would be prudent to assert our power among islands of the Pacific, lest some other country claim them and strike us from the east."
 JAP_regulate_the_social_order_title:0 "Regulate the Social Order"
 JAP_regulate_the_social_order_desc:0 "To prevent another age of chaos, we must make sure that everyone knows their place in society. Samurai must remain samurai, merchants must remain merchants, peasants must remain peasants, and nobody gets any funny ideas to the contrary."
 JAP_dominate_the_market_title:0 "Dominate the Markets"
 JAP_dominate_the_market_desc:0 "Our economic output is astonishing and our prestige is second to none, yet our people overseas still don't get the respect which they rightfully deserve. "
 JAP_go_to_indochina_title:0 "Indochinese Hegemony"
 JAP_go_to_indochina_desc:1 "Our dominion cannot be confined to China alone - we must extend the Emperor's reach even further, so that all can enjoy our sphere of co-prosperity."
 JAP_colonize_california_title:0 "Colonize California"
 JAP_colonize_california_desc:0 "Beyond the sea lies a New World, full of opportunity. Some even whisper of a kingdom wealthy beyond measure, a golden state ripe for the picking. We should establish bases in those lands and profit how we can from what is discovered."
 JAP_siberian_boom:0 "Siberian Boom"
 JAP_gokaido_stations:0 "Gokaido Stations"
